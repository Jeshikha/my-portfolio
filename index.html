          <p>I'm Jess Rama, an aspiring web developer and designer from Mauritius, currently based in Birmingham,
            UK. With a strong passion for web development and design, I am eagerly learning to create beautiful websites
            for local companies. I enrolled in a Web Development and UX Bootcamp at the University of Birmingham to
            learn coding and enhance website creation. </p>
          <p>My passion for this craft is fueled by the desire to assist small
            businesses on the street in establishing a strong online presence. I believe that every business, regardless
            of its size, deserves a captivating website that showcases its unique offerings and reflects the quality of
            its products and services.</p>
          <p>Beyond the world of web development, I find solace and joy in the realm of arts and painting. My travels
            have taken me to over 125 destinations, exposing me to diverse cultures and inspiring my creative pursuits.
            In my free time, you can find me surfing the waves, engaged in a thrilling game of chess, or indulging in
            the excitement of Formula 1 racing. I am also a devoted dog lover and cherish every moment spent in the
            company of these loyal companions.</p>
          <p>My mission is to blend my passion for art and technology to craft websites that leave a lasting impression
            and drive success for businesses. Whether you are starting your online journey or seeking to revamp your
            existing digital presence, I am dedicated to guiding you through the process and creating a website that
            resonates with your audience.</p>
          <p>Let's work together to bring your business into the digital era and unlock its true potential!</p>
